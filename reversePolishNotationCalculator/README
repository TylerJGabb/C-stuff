reverse polish notation calculator

$make run

will start the program after compiling, which then takes integers and operators (+,/,-,*)

numbers and operators are delimited with space


example:

'2 2 2 * *' <-- the quotes are not part of the input, they indicate where input begins and ends. 
	= 8
do not put a space at the end of the last token
